--- Experimental set-up --- 
- Refactor code
- Change to gasplummer model 
- Change position plot to scatter
- Determine physical diagnostics
    - Radius size
    - Energie 
    - Density (rho) 
    - Pressure 
- Run simulation with single massive star in the cloud 
- Implementing stopping condition and (maybe) implement the sink 

--- Carry out experiment ---
- Run simulation for different parameters
- Analyze results
- Write paper 

--- update after several trials ---
- Add output data: initial mass distribution of cluster, cloud.density.max()/mean() vs time
- try larger total mass of cluster (cloud initialization is fine and can be fixed I think)
- try smaller initial velocity of cluster (passing slowly through the cloud does exert more influence to the cloud)
- control `t_end` according to the initial velocity of cluster (don't need to run for long time if `initial_v` is large, since the x/y_limit of the plot has been fixed)
- if possible, don't increase the total mass by assigning large (average) mass to each gas particle or star, instead by increasing the number of particles, though time cost will be more expensive.
