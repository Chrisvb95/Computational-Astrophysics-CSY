--- Experimental set-up --- 
- Refactor code
- Change to gasplummer model 
- Change position plot to scatter
- Determine physical diagnostics
    - Radius size
    - Energie 
    - Density (rho) 
    - Pressure 
- Run simulation with single massive star in the cloud 
- Implementing stopping condition and (maybe) implement the sink 

--- Carry out experiment ---
- Run simulation for different parameters
- Analyse results
- Write paper
